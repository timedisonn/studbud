## Preface
For this project, My pitch was lacking many thingshave incorporated much of the feedback that i received from my consultation session with Rob. First, my specified functions were incomplete, such as the task list and kanban board, and i lack some functions in content managers such as dictionary

## Starting Point

To start, I'm going to fix the issues that are present from my pitch

* Making sure all specifications are functional

* Create the Content managers such as dictionary

* Create the Kanban function

## Design considerations

* Create consistent visual identity for studbud

* Follow best practices


## Original Prototypes

* Landing Page

* Dashboard

* Todolist

* Music Player

* Pomodoro timer


## Programming and changes

* Dashboard

For this page, in this iteration i combined the landing page and home page together, as it was unnecessary. The dashboard contains a simple explanation about Studbud, and button to every apps in it.

* Stopwatch

Stopwatch was quite simple to make, i had to write button functions, how time is incremented by manipulating dom, and i had to style the css page as usual. The stopwatch counts upwards, theres a stop, pause and reset button in it.

* Pomodoro

For the pomodoro page, I learned the pomodoro technique which means that the productive sessions are divided into 25 minute sections and 5 minute break each time. The page again has start, reset, and pause button.

* Todo

For the todo list, I used html tables to get 5 data input from the user, which are task name, time to complete, date, priority, and finish. I used select element for the priority, and used a checkbox to mark finished tasks. Users can save their listed tasks to localstorage

* Kanban

With the kanban board, user can drag and drop their tasks to the 3 columns, which are New Task, Progress, and Finished. This part is particularly challenging, and i had to review my code multiple times to work

* Music Player

For the music player, I used the html audio element to load the music to the page, and i used buttons to manipulate the DOM. Users can play, pause, replay, and reset the music.

* Dictionary

For the Dictionary, i used the dictionaryapi.dev to get the data. The dictionary allows me to fetch dictionary data such as Word, Phonetics, Meanings, and Synonyms.

## Final notes

Designing this website was quite challenging to me. I had quite a hard time to figure out how some js codes work, but the online community has been very helpful for me to troubleshoot my code.

Overall, I think my design could be further refined, but i am happy that it meets the functional specifications of this project. I hope to learn more to get better in web development.
